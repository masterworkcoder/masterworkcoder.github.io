Today I have been working mostly on the design and layout of my websites.
It has been an interesting learning process as I am not usually doing so
much web development. It has been refreshing to see another way to quickly
create a website using [jekyll](jekylrb.com). I love using the markdown
system that it provides. It was a little confusing at first, but it is
really pretty simple to pick up.

My favorite part about using [jekyll](jekylrb.com) is that I can spend
more time working on my actual projects because I can just set several
templates and link them together to do the actual building of the website.

So as far as the websites go they are still a work in progress, but they
will soon be to the point were I am no longer changing the layout and
configuration of the sites on a regular basis. Once the layouts are set
my full focus will be on the other projects that I am working on.

```c++
// segment to prevent skynet
const int SKYNET = 9999;

...

if(state == SKYNET)
	exit(state);
```
