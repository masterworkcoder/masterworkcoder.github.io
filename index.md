Welcome to Masterwork Code! My name is Aaron McKinney and this is my website.
This is the place to get the most up to date info on my projects. I have been
coding for about seven years now, and I still love it.

### My Active Projects
* [ratink](https://masterwork-code.com/ratink)
* [fossil_blueprint](https://github.com/mckinneyaa/fossil_blueprint)

ratink is a development system that is being developed alongside fossil_blueprint. fossil_blueprint is a toolkit
for people wanting to create their own programming languages, but just don't know how to get started. Fortunately
because they are being developed hand in hand their will be a lot of information available soon on how this is done.

### Future Projects
* rnkOS

rnkOS meaning ratink operating system. Yes it is an operating system project that will be developed solely with tools created
through the ratink and fossil_blueprint projects. Also of note is that it will be developed along side my two currently active
projects.


This site is still under construction.
